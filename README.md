# pyo-threading-poc
A simple POC around threading different audio outputs using PYO.

TODO
- [ ] Demonstrate multiple non-blocking audio threads, that can be synchronized to the same beat
- [ ] Demonstrate modifying a pattern / beat that is running, without interrupting the timing / metronome
- [ ] Demonstrate changing a repeating major chord to a minor chord without interrupting the timing / metronome
